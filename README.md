# Memorization Tool V2.0
A memorization tool where the user repeats what they remember of a string and then is given feedback on how much they recited correctly.

------
This second version is written in python built off of my speech to text program repo. Uses whisper model for transcription.

-----
My original version I started was in c++ but I moved to python for this version because of how well python works with Open AI's whisper model
